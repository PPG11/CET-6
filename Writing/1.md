网络教育

With the rapid development of information technology, there is a boom in Internet-based instruction. Most of the universities offer online courses which have gained much popularity among students nowadays.

This new way of teaching brings many advantages. Firstly, it gives much convenience and freedom to students.Students can study at any time and any place as they like, even in pajamas. Secondly, it is very economical because students are not required to come to the campus, and schools can cut the expenditure on electricity and water supply, door keepers’ payment, park lots maintenance and so on. But online learning has drawbacks as well. One of them is that there is no effective way to ensure that students make the required efforts.

As for me, I prefer the traditional way of teaching. The face-to-face communication with teachers can give me more encouragement to learn. As a matter of fact, the direct guidance and class interaction benefit me a lot.

随着信息技术的迅猛发展，基于网络的教育也迅速发展起来。许多大学都开设了网络课程，并且现在这种课程在许多大学生中大受欢迎。

这种新的教育模式有很多的优点，首先，它使学生们的学习更加自由、方便。学生们可以按照自己的喜好选择在任何时间、任何地点学习，甚至穿着睡衣学习都无妨。其次，这种学习方法成本低。学生无须到校园里来，因此学校也就节省了电费、水费、看门人的报酬、停车场的维护费用等等开支。但是，网络教育也有自身的缺陷。其中之一就是，没有行之有效的办法可以确保学生在学习中付出必要的努力。

就我自己而言，我喜欢传统的教学方式。同老师面对面的交流能使我奋进。实际上，老师的直接指导和师生课堂互动使我获益匪浅。
